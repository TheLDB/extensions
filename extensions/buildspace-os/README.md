# buildspace os for raycast

## what is buildspace?

[buildspace](https://buildspace.so) is a global home for builders, and the host of nights and weekends, a 6 week competition for builders to compete and grind, for a shot at $100,000

## what is this extension?

buildspace has a home/extension, found at [buildspace.so/home](https://buildspace.so/home), however if you don't use a supported browser for their extension, or just dont want to use your browser in general, this can be annoying to find.

this extension brings all of the cool features of buildspace os right into your menu bar

## how do you get events?

events are pulled from the [open source api](https://github.com/TheLDB/https://github.com/TheLDB/buildspace-os-raycast-api) i wrote, since events can change overnight, its important that the extension doesn't have to go through a long wait for review just to update a title or link
